<h3>Young Earth Creationism (YEC)</h3>
<p>In my <a routerLink="/{{articles[1]}}">previous article</a>, I mentioned how conversations with Mormon missionaries began to expose to me my own fallacious reasoning. A crisis point eventually developed in my dealings with a staple of the evangelical world: Young Earth Creationism.</p>

<p>I always knew that the account of creation found in Scripture was in conflict with the foundations of modern science. The Christians I know are pretty committed to believing that the world and the whole universe was created in six days around 6,000 years ago. It can’t be any older because if you take the book of Genesis and add up the lifespans mentioned therein, you get a date for creation of around 4000 BC. This view of Scripture and the origin of everything is often called Young Earth Creationism (YEC).</p>

<p>I realize that many folks who are sympathetic to faith (even if they aren’t religious themselves) would consider what I have described above as a straw man, not real Christianity. They might say that I have set up a ‘childish’ version of faith, a ridiculous caricature rather than the real, mature beliefs of science-literate Christians. Indeed, there are Christians who have moved toward a less literal interpretation of the early chapters of the Bible. Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist who has much good to say about religious faith, takes the position that it isn’t until Genesis 12 (after Adam and Eve, after the flood, after the Tower of Babel when God created languages and ethnic groups and spread people out all over the earth) that anything begins that resembles the modern idea of history.</p>

<p>But the fact is that many Christians (and some of the most powerful ones) have NOT moved away from these things at all. This more literal version IS Christianity for millions. It IS Christianity for the most faithful and often the most-opinionated members of my church and my family. It IS Christianity as proclaimed and practiced in many evangelical churches. It IS Christianity as promoted by Jerry Falwell Jr., Liberty University, the Creation Museum, the Ark Park, etc. In fact, my sense is that strong feelings about Young Earth Creation have increased in churches over the past ten or fifteen years. </p>

<p>My own relationship to Young Earth Creationism is complicated. As a child, I accepted it without much question. I knew, of course, that there was a conflict between science and the Bible (as we understood it). I ran into that conflict at school sometimes. But I also knew that the adults in my life expected me to reject evolution as the Devil’s deception. So I did. </p>

<p>In my teens, I read a book or two on the Bible vs. Science (the Bible always won) but these were very much like the Mormon archaeology books I mentioned in the previous article. The authors always started with their beliefs, and then found evidence to fit. The effectiveness of the books depended very much on what you believed going in. </p>

<p>Later, as a young adult and a young minister, I discovered C.S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia and other books of popular theology. Lewis is an evangelical hero, yet it is clear from his writings that he was no Young Earth Creationist. Given his upbringing in England at the start of the 20th century, it may have never occurred to him that he should be. Over time, I more or less made a truce with science. “I believe that God did it. I don’t have to all the details about how he did it, or how long it took. Maybe he did it in six literal days. Maybe he took longer. I’ll find out someday, I guess, when we all get to heaven.” That worked pretty well for me for a while.</p>

<p>In the later years of my ministry, it stopped working so well. As the Christians around me became more and more insistent on Young Earth Creationism, I began to feel the need to push back against junk science and ill-informed attacks on evolution, astronomy, etc. This, of course, is political suicide for the evangelical pastor, and I didn’t do much of it. BTW, I’m no expert on science, but it doesn’t take an expert to realize that much of what is said and written about it in this vein is obscenely off the mark if not intentionally misleading.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to make myself sound like some sort of paragon here. I’ve often been full of crap. But I did get into ministry because, among other reasons, I was drawn to truth. I wanted to know it, to teach it, to live by it and help others do so. I knew I couldn’t be the loyal soldier of Young Earth Creationism that an increasing number seemed to want.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>
