<h3>Tuesdays with Mormons</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, two young Mormon missionaries knocked on our door. Eighteen or nineteen years old, dark dress pants, white shirt, tie, and that name tag identifying each of these kids as ‘Elder’. Most people turn them away. But my wife and I were eager to share our own faith with others, so we took this opportunity to welcome in these two guys who would fit anyone’s description of ‘fine young man’. Thus began 8-10 weeks of exceedingly polite conversations about our faiths.</p>

<p>I had always been warned to be careful talking to Mormon missionaries. People told me that the Latter Day Saints were well-trained, manipulative and extremely knowledgeable about their faith and yours. Such a warning betrays how much of my early church instruction was based on fear of outsiders. It also shows a certain inferiority complex about one’s own ability to engage in discussion with people who see things differently. </p>

<p>But it turns out that such warnings were unnecessary. These young Elders were not especially knowledgeable about their faith, and had only a basic outsiders’ knowledge of mine. Rather than being manipulative, they were unfailingly genial, polite, decent and just plain ordinary. Their messages were missing the threats of eternal torment often associated with missionary zeal. I don’t know how well they represented their church in this, but they both assured me that, if I rejected their message, that was between me and God, and would in no way interfere with our friendly relationship.</p>

<p>These two obviously had received SOME training before being sent forth. They had studied their sacred texts to the point of having a solid, if rudimentary, knowledge of them. They had received instruction on how to conduct themselves in the field (limits on television watching, recreation time, etc.). And they had apparently learned a few basic sales techniques, such as how to make a pitch on the front-doorstep, how to move the conversation along, and how to attempt to ‘close a sale’. </p>

<p>These are the tools they took with them into the mission field of our town, pushed forward by a firmly-held belief that this thing they were doing was without doubt a good thing to do. They were part of a culture back home of parents and grandparents and coaches and church members, all of whom built into these youngsters the conviction that spending two years in small-town Southern America (at their own expense, mind you) knocking on doors, having these conversations...all of this was work that pleased God.</p>

<p>None of their Mormon theology or history was even slightly convincing to me. </p>

<p>In spite of the sincerity of their convictions and the decency of their conduct, there was just no chance that their strange doctrines or their unbelievable history of the Americas would ‘warm my heart’ (a phrase they often used). From the beginning of our association to the end, it was apparent to me that these young men - intelligent though they were, and talented, and emotionally-stable (for all I could tell)  - these young men of good judgment, of whom I had every reason to expect great success as businessmen, husbands, fathers, citizens...had had accepted fiction as fact because the most important people around them did the same.</p>
<p>I was still quite young when all this took place - 27 or 28, I think - and quite immature even for that young age, I’m sure. Still, there was a flicker of recognition in these conversations. I began - just a tiny bit - to see in these Mormons my own situation.</p>

<h5>Plausibility Structures</h5>

<p>Years later, I ran across the sociological term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausibility_structure" target="new">“plausibility structure”</a>. Coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger" target="new">Peter L. Berger</a>, the term refers to all those parents, grandparents, coaches and church leaders I mentioned above, along with aunts, cousins, friends at school, and even characters in books and movies, who share an understanding of reality. Our plausibility structures reaffirm the predominant beliefs of our culture. They make plausible those beliefs that seem strange and unfounded to outsiders. If you are born to Muslim parents in a Muslim country, chances are that you will be Muslim - not just outwardly, but in your attitudes and values. The same is true if you are born in a racist white town in the US, or into a free-thinking family of intellectuals on the Eastern seaboard. And certainly it was true for these young men from Mormon towns in the Western states. And it was true for me too.</p>

<p>I grew up on a farm in Ohio. There were lots of Christians around me. It would be a stretch to say that everyone went to church or espoused Christian values. Far from it. But enough people did. And the people most important to me did. That made it not only <strong>possible</strong> for me to believe, but somewhat <strong>inevitable</strong>. Had I been a skeptic at age 11, for example, or a 13-year-old Buddhist, it would have caused a scandal. Conformity was expected. But that really isn’t the point. Rather, because of my plausibility structure, it barely occured to me to be a skeptic or a Buddhist - only to wonder why others couldn’t see what was so obvious to me. </p>

<p>In a free and open society, people aren’t limited by their plausibility structures. We read, travel, watch movies from around the world, go off to college, get stationed overseas and meet international workers at home. We hear new ideas and sometimes accept them. It’s easier than ever to see through the viewpoint of your parents, especially if you move away from them, as many of us do. Easier...but still, not easy.</p>

<p>Had I grown up in Provo or Salt Lake City, and my parents were Mormon, and so was my basketball coach and my best friend, why wouldn’t I be a Mormon too? I probably would. And if ever I doubted the historical underpinnings of the faith, I could just look around and see that people smarter and better than me believe it. That’s often enough.

    matTooltip="As an aside, all of this makes it incredibly interesting to study how new religions get started in the first place. Mormonism provides a fairly modern case-study that is accessible to historical research."

</p>

<p>Much of what I describe here I learned over decades. During our Mormon conversations, I was many years away from hearing the term ‘plausibility structure’. But I was nevertheless starting to understand the term. (And actually, when I did hear the term, it was like having a motel curtain being pulled back and the light flooding in!) Whatever the merits of my own faith, I knew that I didn’t accept it on the merits. Not at first, anyway. I accepted it because that’s what my ‘tribe’ accepted. What else can you do when you are seven? Or, to borrow (and perhaps twist) Seth Godin’s wonderfully simple words about marketing and culture, I accepted my faith because “People like us believe things like this”.</p>

<p>What about “making it my own?” Did I ever move past the faith inherited from my parents and claim it for myself? I did. I read the Bible, I talked to my preacher (a young man in those days, very mature and stable, a great representative of the church), I read some books, and I took it ‘seriously’, at least in my own estimation. Heck, I even decided to enter the ministry, which meant leaving home for Bible college in Tennessee.
    <i class="material-icons footnote-indicator" 
    matTooltip="This actually was a transgression, and not altogether a minor one, against my family culture, where high value was placed on things like church and ministry, but also on staying within a reasonable driving distance of home. 35 years later I am still in Tennessee with no regrets. But I cannot say for sure that my family value was wrong."

</p>

<p>But in making my faith “my own”, I never looked (or not for long) outside of my plausibility structure. I didn’t study other faiths, or read what skeptics had to say. I didn’t read Nietsche or Thomas Paine or Robert Ingersoll. I mostly studied what other Christians had written. And depending on how wide a Christian is willing to cast his or her net, our sources of knowledge stretch across the world and through centuries long-past. Some churches see themselves as the last remnant of faithful believers on the planet, and so they wouldn’t have anything to do with Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin and the like. But my church was much more mainstream, so my plausibility structure included these men as well as Dostoyevsky, Bonhoeffer, C. S. Lewis, and Philip Yancey, just to name some of my own favorites. </p>

<p>All of these writers make a kind of case for the Christian faith, sometimes brilliantly. For the most part, though, it is a case made from the inside, by believers to believers. One of the blurbs on an edition of many C. S. Lewis paperbacks says that “Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the good man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way”. Exactly. I came to Lewis and the others much more than half-convinced. My intellect, such as it is, wasn’t really getting in the way, but I wanted to give it new tools, and I found in these authors some wonderful exposition on the value of faith (Dostoevsky, especially in Crime and Punishment), the problem of suffering and evil in light of God’s goodness (Lewis and Yancey) and the heroism of standing against evil (Bonhoeffer). But I wasn’t looking to be convinced, only to have my conviction strengthened. I wasn’t asking “Is it true?” but rather “HOW is it true?”
    <i class="material-icons footnote-indicator" 
    matTooltip="To be fair, these favorite authors of mine don’t specialize in showing that Christianity is based on historical events or that the Bible accurately describes our universe. Lewis might well be the convincer of the half-convinced, but only if the skeptic’s objections are philosophical (“Why does God allow evil?”) rather than historical (Did Jesus really exist?”)."

<h5>Confirmation Bias</h5>

<p>During one of these discussions, it occured to me that there must be nothing resembling archaeological evidence for the events in the Book of Mormon. Some of the stories in the book of Mormon are set in the Americas between the time of Christ and the time of Columbus, describing a history unknown outside Mormon literature. To an outsider like me, this certainly appears to be complete fiction.</p>

<p>During the time of these discussions, I was working on a Master’s Degree in New Testament, and one of my professors kept us immersed in Biblical archaeology. It occured to me that all the famous places in the New Testament - Jerusalem, Jericho, Bethlehem, the Decapolis, Rome, etc. - actually existed! Most of them still exist, and the ancient ruins of the Biblical-era towns are among the most-excavated sites in the world.</p>

<p>Not only that, but some of the people in the New Testament are personages of history. Augustus, Herod the Great, Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate - these guys existed. They are all well-attested by history.
    <i class="material-icons footnote-indicator" 
    matTooltip="It occurs to me now that the comparison I was making says no more than that the Jesus story takes place in the historical world whereas the Book of Mormon happens in a fictional universe. Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan stories take place in Washington DC, Moscow and around the ‘present-day’ world. That doesn’t make them any more historical than the Lord of the Rings."
    matTooltipClass="footnotes"
    >more_horiz</i>
</p>

<p>At that point, it hadn’t occurred to me that one major character in the New Testament is unknown to the contemporary history of his day, and that is Jesus of Nazareth. Outside the sacred text itself, Jesus is unknown and unmentioned until the church begins to establish itself as a force in the world. Also unmentioned, of course, are the miracles and teachings of the Gospels. </p>

<p>I thought that this lack of physical evidence put my Mormon friends at a real disadvantage here. How could they expect me to buy their tales of an unknown history of the Americas without at least some archeological evidence that the lost civilization ever existed?</p>

<p>I did win a short-term victory with that challenge. The guys seemed to have never considered this before.</p>

<p>Never considered this?! How could it be? How could you accept such a fantastical story without even thinking of whether or not there is evidence? Ah, but these are the questions of an outsider, not of people within the plausibility structure. From the inside, it’s not about the historical evidence, but about the whole network of family and friends and rituals that make it believable. In my childhood, I accepted the beliefs of Christianity at face value. Before I left for college, I don’t think questions of historical veracity entered my mind. And what’s more, my impression is that this is the experience of the vast majority of believers. We simply don’t look for the kind of evidence for our own beliefs that we would demand of others. Such evidence just isn’t the point. Lots of others believe (which is often taken as evidence of God’s blessing). It gives meaning to my life. Besides, people smarter than me have looked into the evidence. In the end, the evidence just isn’t that important. </p>

<p>So my missionaries told me they’d look into the archaeology and get back to me. When they asked the leader of their local congregation about it, he laughed in a reassuring way, and told them: “Here, I have tons of books about our archaeology. Take these and lend them to our poor, confused lambs, and see what they say”. So they brought me several books on the archaeology of the BOM.</p>

<p>But these weren’t really archaeology books. Instead, they were travelogues, picture books of Central and South America, photo essays of the ruins of Mayan and Aztec civilizations, along with descriptions of various features of the ruins, topped off with a large helping of what I know recognize as <strong>confirmation bias</strong>. What I mean is something along the lines of this: “Notice the shapes carved into the top of this pillar. Doesn’t this call to mind that well-known passage in our beloved book which says…”</p>

<p>At this point, my critique of Mormon faith falters. I cannot cite a single example of what I describe. I returned the books nearly 30 years ago, and haven’t had the inclination to seek them out again. But my intention these days isn’t to criticize Mormon archaeology at all. Perhaps it is in a much stronger state than I represent here. </p>

<p>No, the thing that stays with me decades later wasn’t the shoddy archaeology. It was, again, recognition. </p>

<p>Confirmation bias is our ability to see most clearly the things that conform to our already-formed opinions. If I think, for example, that the clerks at my grocery store are disrespectful, I tend to notice the rude acts, and disregard any courtesy. More than that, I tend to interpret ambiguous actions as being lazy or rude. If an employee doesn’t tell me to have a nice day, I assume it’s rudeness rather than preoccupation with her own troubles, forgetfulness or even laryngitis. </p>

<p>Confirmation bias is a deeply-embedded human trait. It colors our politics. It makes it hard to see real change in our children, or in a once-faithless friend, or in an addict trying to make a real change. Once we think we know something, we know how to find evidence that supports it. Epictetus said that “It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.” I’d add that it’s impossible for him to unlearn it too. Or NEARLY impossible, because I was at least beginning to see this tendency in myself.</p>

<p>Forget the Mormons for a minute. How did I use MY faith to explain the world? How did I deal with science, and explain mystery and unravel the complex? How did I decide what was really true and valuable? </p>

<p>It wasn’t by evidence. It wasn’t by honest inquiry. It wasn’t by searching out the truth and following the facts wherever they might lead. All of these are things I <strong>thought</strong> I valued. But now I began to recognize that I practiced none of them, not in the big questions of life that framed all of the rest, and not in my career. What I did instead was to take the Bible as the lens through which I saw everything else, the Rosetta stone used to interpret everything. This, BTW, would not be considered a criticism to Bible-believing Christians. “This is what we are SUPPOSED to do”, they would say. But when I saw someone else doing it, I began to see how such a practice prevents evidence from ever getting through. What kind of method is that for finding the truth about things?</p>

<hr>

<p>For example: I always knew that the account of creation found in Scripture was in conflict with the foundations of modern science. The Christians I know are pretty committed to believing that the world and the whole universe was created in six days around 6,000 years ago. It can’t be any older because if you take the book of Genesis and add up the lifespans mentioned therein, you get a “date” for creation of around 4000 BC. This view of Scripture and the origin of everything is often called Young Earth Creationism.</p>

<p>I realize that many folks who are sympathetic to faith (even if they aren’t religious themselves) would consider what I have described above as “not real Christianity”. They might say that I have set up a ‘childish’ version of faith as a straw man, a ridiculous caricature of modern faith rather than the real, mature beliefs of science-literate Christians. Indeed, there are Christians who have moved toward a less literal interpretation of the early chapters of the Bible. Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist who has much good to say about religious faith, takes the position that it isn’t until Genesis 12 (after Adam and Eve, after the flood, after the Tower of Babel when God created languages and ethnic groups and spread people out all over the earth) that anything begins that resembles the modern idea of history.</p>

<p>But the fact is that many Christians (and some of the most powerful ones) have NOT moved away from these things at all. This more literal version IS Christianity for millions. It IS Christianity for the most faithful and often the most-opinionated members of my church and my family. It IS Christianity as proclaimed and practiced in many evangelical churches. It IS Christianity as promoted by Jerry Falwell Jr., Liberty University, the Creation Museum, the Ark Park, etc. In fact, my sense is that strong feelings about Young Earth Creation have increased in churches over the past ten or fifteen years. </p>

<p>My own relationship to Young Earth Creationism - is complicated. As a child, I accepted it without much question. I knew, of course, that there was a conflict between science and the Bible (as we understood it). I ran into that conflict at school sometimes. But I also knew that the adults in my life expected me to reject evolution as the Devil’s deception. So I did. </p>

<p>In my teens, I read a book or two on the Bible vs. Science (the Bible always won) but these were very much like the Mormon archaeology books I mentioned. The author started with his beliefs, and then found evidence to fit. The effectiveness of the books depended very much on what you believed going in. </p>

<p>Later, as a young adult and a young minister, I discovered C.S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia and other books of popular theology. Lewis is an evangelical hero, yet it is clear from his writings that he was no Young Earth Creationist. Given his upbringing in England at the start of the 20th century, it may have never occurred to him that he should be. Over time, I more or less made a truce with science. “I believe that God did it. I don’t have to all the details about how he did it, or how long it took. Maybe he did it in six literal days. Maybe he took longer. I’ll find out someday, I guess, when we all get to heaven.” That worked pretty well for me for a while.</p>

<p>In the later years of my ministry, it stopped working so well. As the Christians around me became more and more insistent on Young Earth Creationism, I began to feel the need to push back against junk science and ill-informed attacks on evolution, astronomy, etc. This, of course, is political suicide for the evangelical pastor, and I didn’t do much of it. BTW, I’m no expert on science, but it doesn’t take an expert to realize that much of what is said and written about it in this vein is obscenely off the mark if not intentionally misleading.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to make myself sound like some sort of paragon here. I’ve often been full of crap. But I did get into ministry because, among other reasons, I was drawn to truth. I wanted to know it, to teach it, to live by it and help others do so. I knew I couldn’t be the loyal soldier of Young Earth Creationism that an increasing number seemed to want.</p>

<p>Over the decades, I have heard Christians say many times that you cannot accept only part of the Bible and reject the rest. It’s all or nothing! You have to accept it all, or you are rejecting it all. This, BTW, is a position which is full of problems. It implies that the Bible is a single thing with one author and one intent. In fact, the Bible is a library of 66 books written over centuries, many of which are of unknown origin and authorship. To even think of the Bible as a unified statement is a luxury afforded to us since the dawn of printing when it (barely) become possible to put the whole thing under one cover. It contains a variety of perspectives that can hardly be welded into a cohesive whole, and in fact the main character of the New Testament, Jesus, said that he came to fulfill the older part of the Bible and usher in a new era. Today’s Christians follow him in this, ignoring huge swaths of the Old Testament, and reading the rest of it not on its own terms but rather interpreting it through the teachings of Jesus and the Apostle Paul. </p>

<p>All of this is to say that it is impossible to describe what it might mean to accept the whole Bible as God’s inerrant and perfect word. Of course I understand what it means to make the profession with your lips. I have made it myself. But if I say that I’m going to live my life according to the teachings in the Bible, you assume and hope that I don’t mean the part about taking personal revenge or the part about killing a disobedient child or the part about taking young virgin slave girls as the spoils of war. </p>

<p>It’s possible that I mean that I’m going to try to live in accord with the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. It’s possible for someone to try that. The Sermon on the Mount is just three short chapters that you can read in twenty minutes. It’s mostly a cohesive whole. Many Christians would tell you that it’s the best and highest teaching Jesus ever spoke. But if I announced my plan to follow the Bible, you probably wouldn’t assume I was going to live out the Sermon on the Mount. The fact is, I’ve known far less than ten Christians in my lifetime that have even attempted it for any length of time. I could conclude from that evidence that none of us really believed it or accepted it as the Word of God. But instead, let’s just say that the Sermon on the Mount is too hard.</p>

<p>In fact, if I say I’m going to live by the Bible, you can assume that what I probably mean is that I’m going to try to live according to a selection of Scriptures gathered from the various books of the Bible that describe and prescribe decency, honesty, truthfulness, kindness and good character of a kind that is found in most religions and philosophies. This is the sum of what most Christians are after, in my observation. It’s a worthy way to live too. But it’s hardly the same thing as letting your whole life be shaped by an instruction book from God, which is exactly what Christians tend to claim, even though the Bible isn’t that kind of book.</p>

<p>So back to the idea that you have to accept the whole Bible, or else reject it all, that you can’t accept only part of it. I say that, for all practical purposes, accepting only PART of the Bible is the ONLY thing you can do. It’s the only thing Christians have ever done because it is the only possible thing. </p>

<p>Again, I realize that it is possible to profess belief in the whole of the Bible as God’s word. But I think it borders on meaninglessness to do that. There is simply no way to live that out.</p>

<p>And I understand that it is possible to honor the Bible in your mind, and to draw out moral lessons even from some of the uglier parts that you mostly avoid. I’m convinced that this is what most Christians do, even if they claim more.</p>
