<h3>Telling lies does not tend to unfit a person...</h3>
<p class="reference">From <i>On Bullshit</i> by Harry G. Frankfurt</p>	
<hr>
<p>For this reason, telling lies does not tend to unfit a person for telling the truth in the same way that bullshitting tends to. Through excessive indulgence in the latter activity, which involves making assertions without paying attention to anything except what it suits one to say, a person’s normal habit of attending to the way things are may be attenuated or lost. Someone who lies and someone who tells the truth are playing on opposite sides, so to speak, in the same game. Each responds to the facts as he understands them, although the response of the one is guided by the authority of the truth, while the response of the other defies that authority and refuses to meet its demands. The bullshitter ignores those demands altogether. He does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.</p>
<p>Bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about...Closely related instances arise from the widespread conviction that it is the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy to have opinions about everything…</p>
