<h3>C&uacute;chulainn</h3>
<p class="reference">From <i>What It Is Like to Go to War</i> by Karl Marlantes</p>	
<p>When C&uacute;chulainn, the warrior hero of the <i>T&aacute;in</i>, returned to the walls of Emain Macha from combat, the three heads of Nechta Sc&eacute;ne's sons with him, a swan flock he'd captured fluttering above him, a wild stag behind his chariot, he turned the left chariot board toward Emain in insult, and he said: "I swear by the oath of Ulster's people that if a man isn't found to fight me, I'll spill the blood of everyone in this court."</p>
<p>"Naked women to him!" Conchobar mac Nessa (the king) said.</p>
<p>The women of Emain went forth, with Mugain (the queen), the wife of Conchobar, at their head, and they stripped and showed their breasts to him.</p>
<p>"These are the warriors you must struggle with today," Mugain said.</p>
<p>C&uacute;chulainn "hid his countenance" and immediately was thrown by the warriors into a cold bath, which began to boil from his heat and burst the vat. They threw him into another vat and that boiled with bubbles "the size of fists" and then they threw him into a third vat and he warmed it to the point where its heat and his own were equal. At this point Mugain clothed him in a blue cloak with a silver brooch. He at last has shed his warrior garments and is ready to be part of the community again. Then he "sat on Conchobar's knee" (the king's knee, not the throne, and certainly not on the floor) and "that was his seat ever after."</p>
