<h3>Tuesdays with Mormons</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, two young Mormon missionaries knocked on our door. Eighteen or nineteen years old, dark dress pants, white shirt, tie, and that name tag identifying each of these kids as ‘Elder’. Most people turn them away. But my wife and I were eager to share our own faith with others, so we took this opportunity to welcome in these two guys who would fit anyone’s description of ‘fine young man’. Thus began 8-10 weeks of exceedingly polite conversations about our faiths.</p>

<p>I had always been warned to be careful talking to Mormon missionaries. People told me that the Latter Day Saints were well-trained, manipulative and extremely knowledgeable about their faith and yours. Such a warning betrays how much of my early church instruction was based on fear of outsiders. It also shows a certain inferiority complex about one’s own ability to engage in discussion with people who see things differently. </p>

<p>But it turns out that such warnings were unnecessary. These young Elders were not especially knowledgeable about their faith, and had only a basic outsiders’ knowledge of mine. Rather than being manipulative, they were unfailingly genial, polite, decent and just plain ordinary. Their messages were missing the threats of eternal torment often associated with missionary zeal. I don’t know how well they represented their church in this, but they both assured me that, if I rejected their message, that was between me and God, and would in no way interfere with our friendly relationship.</p>

<p>These two obviously had received SOME training before being sent forth. They had studied their sacred texts to the point of having a solid, if rudimentary, knowledge of them. They had received instruction on how to conduct themselves in the field (limits on television watching, recreation time, etc.). And they had apparently learned a few basic sales techniques, such as how to make a pitch on the front-doorstep, how to move the conversation along, and how to attempt to ‘close a sale’. </p>

<p>These are the tools they took with them into the mission field of our town, pushed forward by a firmly-held belief that this thing they were doing was without doubt a good thing to do. They were part of a culture back home - a plausibility structure - of parents and grandparents and coaches and church members, all of whom built into these youngsters the conviction that spending two years in small-town Southern America (at their own expense, mind you) knocking on doors, having these conversations...all of this was work that pleased God.</p>

<p>None of their Mormon theology or history was even slightly convincing to me. </p>

<p>In spite of the sincerity of their convictions and the decency of their conduct, there was just no chance that their strange doctrines or their unbelievable history of the Americas would ‘warm my heart’ (a phrase they often used). From the beginning of our association to the end, it was apparent to me that these young men - intelligent though they were, and talented, and emotionally-stable (for all I could tell)  - these young men of good judgment, of whom I had every reason to expect great success as businessmen, husbands, fathers, citizens...had had accepted fiction as fact because the most important people around them did the same.</p>
<p>I was still quite young when all this took place - 27 or 28, I think - and quite immature even for that young age, I’m sure. Still, there was a flicker of recognition in these conversations. I began - just a tiny bit - to see in these Mormons my own situation.</p>
