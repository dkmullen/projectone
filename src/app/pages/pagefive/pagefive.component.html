<h3>Tuesdays with Mormons</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, two young Mormon missionaries knocked on our door. Eighteen or nineteen years old, dark dress pants, white shirt, tie, and that name tag identifying each of these kids as ‘Elder’. Most people turn them away. But my wife and I were eager to share our own faith with others, so we took this opportunity to welcome in these two guys who would fit anyone’s description of ‘fine young man’. Thus began 8-10 weeks of exceedingly polite conversations about our faiths.</p>

<p>I had always been warned to be careful talking to Mormon missionaries. People told me that the Latter Day Saints were well-trained, manipulative and extremely knowledgeable about their faith and yours. Such a warning betrays how much of my early church instruction was based on fear of outsiders. It also shows a certain inferiority complex about one’s own ability to engage in discussion with people who see things differently. </p>

<p>But it turns out that such warnings were unnecessary. These young Elders were not especially knowledgeable about their faith, and had only a basic outsiders’ knowledge of mine. Rather than being manipulative, they were unfailingly genial, polite, decent and just plain ordinary. Their messages were missing the threats of eternal torment often associated with missionary zeal. I don’t know how well they represented their church in this, but they both assured me that, if I rejected their message, that was between me and God, and would in no way interfere with our friendly relationship.</p>

<p>These two obviously had received SOME training before being sent forth. They had studied their sacred texts to the point of having a solid, if rudimentary, knowledge of them. They had received instruction on how to conduct themselves in the field (limits on television watching, recreation time, etc.). And they had apparently learned a few basic sales techniques, such as how to make a pitch on the front-doorstep, how to move the conversation along, and how to attempt to ‘close a sale’. </p>

<p>These are the tools they took with them into the mission field of our town, pushed forward by a firmly-held belief that this thing they were doing was without doubt a good thing to do. They were part of a culture back home of parents and grandparents and coaches and church members, all of whom built into these youngsters the conviction that spending two years in small-town Southern America (at their own expense, mind you) knocking on doors, having these conversations...all of this was work that pleased God.</p>

<p>None of their Mormon theology or history was even slightly convincing to me. </p>

<p>In spite of the sincerity of their convictions and the decency of their conduct, there was just no chance that their strange doctrines or their unbelievable history of the Americas would ‘warm my heart’ (a phrase they often used). From the beginning of our association to the end, it was apparent to me that these young men - intelligent though they were, and talented, and emotionally-stable (for all I could tell)  - these young men of good judgment, of whom I had every reason to expect great success as businessmen, husbands, fathers, citizens...had had accepted fiction as fact because the most important people around them did the same.</p>
<p>I was still quite young when all this took place - 27 or 28, I think - and quite immature even for that young age, I’m sure. Still, there was a flicker of recognition in these conversations. I began - just a tiny bit - to see in these Mormons my own situation.</p>

<h5>Plausibility Structures</h5>

<p>Years later, I ran across the sociological term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausibility_structure" target="new">“plausibility structure”</a>. Coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger" target="new">Peter L. Berger</a>, the term refers to all those parents, grandparents, coaches and church leaders I mentioned above, along with aunts, cousins, friends at school, and even characters in books and movies, who share an understanding of reality. Our plausibility structures reaffirm the predominant beliefs of our culture. They make plausible those beliefs that seem strange and unfounded to outsiders. If you are born to Muslim parents in a Muslim country, chances are that you will be Muslim - not just outwardly, but in your attitudes and values. The same is true if you are born in a racist white town in the US, or into a free-thinking family of intellectuals on the Eastern seaboard. And certainly it was true for these young men from Mormon towns in the Western states. And it was true for me too.</p>

<p>I grew up on a farm in Ohio. There were lots of Christians around me. It would be a stretch to say that everyone went to church or espoused Christian values. Far from it. But enough people did. And the people most important to me did. That made it not only <strong>possible</strong> for me to believe, but somewhat <strong>inevitable</strong>. Had I been a skeptic at age 11, for example, or a 13-year-old Buddhist, it would have caused a scandal. Conformity was expected. But that really isn’t the point. Rather, because of my plausibility structure, it barely occured to me to be a skeptic or a Buddhist - only to wonder why others couldn’t see what was so obvious to me. </p>

<p>In a free and open society, people aren’t limited by their plausibility structures. We read, travel, watch movies from around the world, go off to college, get stationed overseas and meet international workers at home. We hear new ideas and sometimes accept them. It’s easier than ever to see through the viewpoint of your parents, especially if you move away from them, as many of us do. Easier...but still, not easy.</p>

<p>Had I grown up in Provo or Salt Lake City, and my parents were Mormon, and so was my basketball coach and my best friend, why wouldn’t I be a Mormon too? I probably would. And if ever I doubted the historical underpinnings of the faith, I could just look around and see that people smarter and better than me believe it. That’s often enough.

<p>Much of what I describe here I learned over decades. During our Mormon conversations, I was many years away from hearing the term ‘plausibility structure’. But I was nevertheless starting to understand the term. (And actually, when I did hear the term, it was like having a motel curtain being pulled back and the light flooding in!) Whatever the merits of my own faith, I knew that I didn’t accept it on the merits. Not at first, anyway. I accepted it because that’s what my ‘tribe’ accepted. What else can you do when you are seven? Or, to borrow (and perhaps twist) Seth Godin’s wonderfully simple words about marketing and culture, I accepted my faith because “People like us believe things like this”.</p>

<p>What about “making it my own?” Did I ever move past the faith inherited from my parents and claim it for myself? I did. I read the Bible, I talked to my preacher (a young man in those days, very mature and stable, a great representative of the church), I read some books, and I took it ‘seriously’, at least in my own estimation. Heck, I even decided to enter the ministry, which meant leaving home for Bible college in Tennessee.

    matTooltip="This actually was a transgression, and not altogether a minor one, against my family culture, where high value was placed on things like church and ministry, but also on staying within a reasonable driving distance of home. 35 years later I am still in Tennessee with no regrets. But I cannot say for sure that my family value was wrong."

<p>But in making my faith “my own”, I never looked (or not for long) outside of my plausibility structure. I didn’t study other faiths, or read what skeptics had to say. I didn’t read Nietsche or Thomas Paine or Robert Ingersoll. I mostly studied what other Christians had written. And depending on how wide a Christian is willing to cast his or her net, our sources of knowledge stretch across the world and through centuries long-past. Some churches see themselves as the last remnant of faithful believers on the planet, and so they wouldn’t have anything to do with Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin and the like. But my church was much more mainstream, so my plausibility structure included these men as well as Dostoyevsky, Bonhoeffer, C. S. Lewis, and Philip Yancey, just to name some of my own favorites. </p>

<p>All of these writers make a kind of case for the Christian faith, sometimes brilliantly. For the most part, though, it is a case made from the inside, by believers to believers. One of the blurbs on an edition of many C. S. Lewis paperbacks says that “Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the good man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way”. Exactly. I came to Lewis and the others much more than half-convinced. My intellect, such as it is, wasn’t really getting in the way, but I wanted to give it new tools, and I found in these authors some wonderful exposition on the value of faith (Dostoevsky, especially in Crime and Punishment), the problem of suffering and evil in light of God’s goodness (Lewis and Yancey) and the heroism of standing against evil (Bonhoeffer). But I wasn’t looking to be convinced, only to have my conviction strengthened. I wasn’t asking “Is it true?” but rather “HOW is it true?”
    <i class="material-icons footnote-indicator" 
    matTooltip="To be fair, these favorite authors of mine don’t specialize in showing that Christianity is based on historical events or that the Bible accurately describes our universe. Lewis might well be the convincer of the half-convinced, but only if the skeptic’s objections are philosophical (“Why does God allow evil?”) rather than historical (Did Jesus really exist?”)."
